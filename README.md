A JavaScript frontend and Rails backend web application that allows user read, submit, and update environmental posts as well as provide feedback/reactions to the submitted posts. The idea behind this was that I wanted to create an online space for environmental education, idea sharing, and mitigative inspiration. This is the frontend repo, you can find my backend repo here: https://github.com/denalibalser/eco-forum-backend.
